                Enjoy 4 nights at the Dolphin hotel! Just 20 minutes from the Orlando
                airport, it is centrally located in the heart of Walt Disney
                World.
                <br />
                <br /> Besides being just a short distance away from the theme
                parks, the Dolphin hotel is also home to a number of fun
                recreational activities. From pristine pools and beaches, to the
                kids-only Camp Dolphin, young guests are kept entertained even
                after they return from a day at the park. The Dolphin hotel is
                also located near many activities that parents can enjoy such as
                spending a relaxing afternoon at the Mandara Spa or playing a
                round of golf on any one of the four championship Walt Disney
                World golf courses.
